\section{Method of intuitive consideration, its application in elementary number theory}

\subsection{Notion of a numeral; ``smaller than'' relation; addition}

\paragraph{} %  1
The question has been raised whether we can just ``directly'' address
the matter of existence and consistency.

It's worth mentioning that this existential axiomatic approach is not
``the original approach'' to mathematics.

\paragraph{Euclid} %  2
Euclid worked with a more contentual axiomatic method. The intuitive
meaning of ``figures'' [the basic notions] was clear in Euclid's
\emph{Elements}.

Further, its axioms are not in ``existential form'' either. There is
no presupposition that the domain of individuals consists of points
and lines.

Euclid does not work with existential axioms, but gives us
constructional postulates instead.

\paragraph{Constructional postulates} %  3
Such ``constructional postulates'' tell us \emph{it is always possible
to construct a line passing through two distinct points}, and \emph{it
is possible to construct a circle centered at a given point with a
given radius}.

\paragraph{} %  4
This only works if the postulates are viewed [\textit{angesehen werden\/}] as expressions [\textit{Austrucks\/}]
of a known actuality [\textit{Tats\"{a}chlichen\/}] or of direct
evidence [\textit{unmittelbaren Evidenz\/}].

``It is well known'' the question regarding ``the scope of validity of
geometry'' is contraversial (by which I think Hilbert and Bernays
means: there is no single model of geometry; instead there are many
\emph{non-Euclidean} geometries discovered in the 19th century).

Hilbert and Bernays argues that a substantial advantage of formal
axiomatics is that it makes the grounding of geometry
\emph{independent} of this question.

\paragraph{} %  5
We're not concerned with these types of issues in elementary number
theory. We don't need to worry about the character of knowledge of
geometric matters.

Furthermore, in elementary number theory (and elementary algebra), we
find ``the purest'' manifestation of the ``standpoint of direct
contentual thought'' which has evolved ``without axiomatic assumptions''.

\paragraph{} %  6
This methodological standpoint is characterized by ``thought
experiments'' [\textit{Gedankenexperimenten\/}] with things that are
assumed to be ``concretely present'' [\textit{konkrete vorgliegend\/}]
such as numbers in number theory (or expressions of letters with
numerical coefficients in elementary algebra).

\paragraph{} %  7
Hilbert and Bernays analyze this situation more closely in this
chapter.

In number theory, we have ``an initial thing'' and ``a process of progression''.
We must fix both intuitively in some definite way. It is inessential
how we do this, but the choice must be maintained.

Hilbert and Bernays choose ``1'' as ``the initial thing'', and
appending as a suffix ``1''.

\paragraph{} %  8
The things we obtain, starting with 1, by applying this progression,
we obtain guys like
\begin{equation*}
1,\quad11,\quad111,\quad1111,\dots
\end{equation*}
The process is just appending ``1'' to the previous entry in the sequence.

\subparagraph{``Figures''}
Hilbert and Bernays refers to the result of this construction process
as ``figures'' [German: \textit{Figur\/}]. This is the first time this
word appears in this chapter. I am uncertain what to make of its
significance. 

\subparagraph{Finitistic property}
Critically, Hilbert and Bernays note that we have used a ``concrete
\emph{construction} which terminates'', and that this ``construction''
[\textit{Aufbau\/}] can therefore be reversed in terms of a
step-by-step \emph{decomposition} [\textit{Abbau\/}].

If we wanted to generalize Hilbert's programme from ``contentual
number theory'' as the metatheory to, say, some sort of statically
typed total functional programming language, then these properties are
crucial (and are satisfied by algebraic data types).

\paragraph{} %  9
Openly announcing we're deviating from common usage of language,
Hilbert and Bernays refers to these figures as ``numerals''.

\paragraph{``Unambiguously recognizable'': tolerance of orthographics} % 10
Hilbert and Bernays announce a willing tolerance in the orthographics
of these figures. Presumably a certain degree of ambiguity arises when
writing with pen on paper (the spacing between the figures, the height
of the figures, the various possible serifs attached [or not] to
figures, etc.) which we should understand and allow.

They refer to this tolerance of orthographic variability a property
called ``unambiguously recognizable''.

\paragraph{Communication signs disjoint from numerals} % 11
There is another class of signs which Hilbert and Bernays call
``communication signs''. These are fundamentally different than
numerals, because numerals constitute the ``objects'' of number theory.

\subparagraph{In $\FS0/$}
If I were to reflect this choice in $\FS0/$, it would make sense to
introduce a primitive atom encoding $1$ and then work with
tuples of $1$ as numerals. All other atoms would be ``communication signs''.

\paragraph{} % 12
A ``symbol for communication'' by itself is also a figure.

Therefore symbols for communication should also be
``unambiguously recognizable''.

Within the theory (of elementary number theory), no ``symbol of communication''
is made into an ``object of consideration'', but it merely serves as a
means for concise, clear formulation of facts, assertions,
assumptions.

(This seems to be borrowing a similar notion from Russell and
Bernays's \textit{Principia Mathematica}.)

\paragraph{Symbols of communication in number theory} % 13
In elementary number theory, Hilbert and Bernays offers the following
symbols of communication:
\begin{enumerate}
\item ``small German letters'' [i.e., Fraktur letters] as variables
  for numerals
\item the customary number symbols as abbreviations for definite
  numerals (e.g., ``2'' for ``11'', ``3'' for ``111'', etc.)
\item symbols for certain formation processes and operations of
  calculation, which may be applied to definite as well as indefinite
  numerals (e.g., ``$\mathfrak{a}+11$'')
\item the symbol ``='' to communicate ``figural coincidence'', and the
  symbol ``$\neq$'' to communicate difference of numerals; the symbols
  ``$<$'' and ``$>$'' will be used for the relation of magnitude
  (which will be discussed in a minute)
\item parentheses as symbols for the order of processes, where this
  order is not clear without further explanation.
\end{enumerate}

\paragraph{} % 14
The way these symbols work and their contentual meanings will be made
clear as we work our way through elementary number theory.

\paragraph{Relation of magnitude} % 15
The first thing Hilbert and Bernays does: clarify the relation of
magnitude. Let numeral $\mathfrak{a}$ be different from
$\mathfrak{b}$. How is this possible?

Both must begin with ``1'' and iteratively append ``1'' finitely many
times. But one stops whereas the other continues; i.e., one is the
``initial segment'' of the other.

Since these are different numerals, one must be the \emph{proper}
initial segment of the other.

\paragraph{} % 16
If the numeral $\mathfrak{a}$ coincides with an initial segment of
$\mathfrak{b}$, then we say ``$\mathfrak{a}$ is smaller than $\mathfrak{b}$''
(or equivalently, ``$\mathfrak{b}$ is greater than $\mathfrak{a}$'').
For this, we use the notation
\begin{equation*}
\mathfrak{a}<\mathfrak{b},\qquad\mathfrak{b}>\mathfrak{a}.
\end{equation*}

\subparagraph{Strict and total}
It follows from the previous consideration that for any numerals
$\mathfrak{a}$ and $\mathfrak{b}$, exactly one of the following must
always hold:
\begin{enumerate}
\item $\mathfrak{a} < \mathfrak{b}$,
\item $\mathfrak{a} = \mathfrak{b}$,
\item $\mathfrak{a} > \mathfrak{b}$.
\end{enumerate}
Moreover, these are mutually exclusive possibilities.

\subparagraph{Transitivity}
Further, ``it is obvious'' that
if $\mathfrak{a}<\mathfrak{b}$ and $\mathfrak{b}<\mathfrak{c}$,
then $\mathfrak{a}<\mathfrak{c}$.

I think this is not true, I think that we could prove this claim. But
I am uninterested in the tedium needed to prove it.

\paragraph{Addition operator} % 17
When we have numerals $\mathfrak{b}<\mathfrak{a}$, we can identify the
initial segment of $\mathfrak{a}$ which coincides with
$\mathfrak{b}$. Then we can identify a numeral $\mathfrak{c}$ which
coincides with the remaining segment of $\mathfrak{a}$.

If we're given $\mathfrak{b}$ and $\mathfrak{c}$, then we can
construct a new numeral by appending $\mathfrak{c}$ after
$\mathfrak{b}$. This defines addition, and we write
$\mathfrak{b}+\mathfrak{c}$ for this operation.

\paragraph{} % 18
If a numeral $\mathfrak{b}<\mathfrak{a}$ coincides with a segment of
$\mathfrak{a}$, then the remaining segment of $\mathfrak{a}$ is again
a numeral $\mathfrak{c}$. 

In this case, we have a representation for $\mathfrak{a}$
of the form $\mathfrak{b}+\mathfrak{c}$, where $\mathfrak{c}$ is a
numeral.

Moreover, we have
\begin{equation*}
\mathfrak{b} < \mathfrak{b} + \mathfrak{c}.
\end{equation*}

For a concrete example, ``2'' mean ``11'' and ``3'' means ``111'', and
``5'' means ``11111''. We see that ``$2 + 3$'' stands for appending
``111'' (i.e., three appending operations of ``1'') to ``11'', giving
us ``11111''. And that's precisely ``5''.

\paragraph{Example of a false proposition} % 19
The proposition ``$2+3=4$'' is an example of a false proposition.

\subsection[Laws of calculation]{Laws of calculation; mathematical induction; multiplication; divisibility; prime number}

\paragraph{} % 20
Hilbert and Bernays now turn their attention to proving the validity
of the laws of calculation involving this newly defined ``addition''
operation.

\paragraph{} % 21
The ``laws of calculation'' are regarded as sentences involving
arbitrary numerals. They are seen to hold by ``intuitive consideration''.

I am taking this to mean that the ``discussions'' which follow are
examples of what qualifies as an ``intuitive consideration''.

\section{The finitistic standpoint; transgression of this standpoint already in number theory}

\subsection{Logical characterization of the finitistic standpoint}
\paragraph{} % 69

Mueller~\cite[p.44]{mueller2006grundlagen} translates this paragraph
as:
\begin{quote}
The consideration of the principles of number theory and algebra has
served to show us the application and use of direct contentual
inference carried out in thought experiments performed on intuitively
imagined objects and free from axiomatic assumptions. We will call
this kind of inference ``[finitistic]'' [\textit{finit\/}] inference
in order to have a short expression; likewise we shall call the
attitude underlying this kind of inference the ``finitistic'' attitude
or point of view. We will speak of finitistic concepts or assertions
in the same sense; in using the word ``finitistic'' we convey the idea
that the consideration, assertion or definition in question remains
within the limits of objects which it is in principle possible to
observe and of processes which it is in principle possible to
complete; that it is carried out in the framework of concrete thought.
