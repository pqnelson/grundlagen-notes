These are reading notes on various English translations of Hilbert and
Bernays's _Grundlagen der Mathematiks_, volume I, the 1970 edition.

To build the PDF, just run `make` in a shell. You'll need LaTeX and
dvipdfmx, but you can use pdfLaTeX if you want (or whatever).

Also note that I am grouping notes by Hilbert and Bernays's paragraphs.
That is to say, I am numbering the paragraphs of the German 1970
edition's text (skipping over numbered items, i.e., the equivalent of
an `\item` is not counted as a paragraph), then using this to organize
my reading notes.

I do not expect to get much further than chapter 5 or 6 of volume I,
because there are no English translations of anything beyond that (and
I have no interest in trying to translate the German into English: it
is much too elegant for me).
